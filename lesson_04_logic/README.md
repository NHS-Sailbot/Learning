# Logic

So far, we've covered the main function, as well as splitting up repitive parts of 
our code into sub-functions, however we are only able to create a purely sequential
program. In this lesson we will go over the different ways to introduce branching 
into our code.

There are a few different ways to control the flow of our program, all of which were
inherited from C.

There are two different [branch statements](#Branch-statements)
 - [If/Else statements](#If-and-else-statements)
 - [Switch statements](#Switch-statements)

and two different types of [loops](#Loops)
 - [For/Ranged For loops](#For-loops)
 - [While/Do-While loops](#While-loops)

# Branch statements

## If and else statements

If and else statements are most likely the most used control flow elements of the 
language. They allow the programmer to 

## Switch statements

# Loops

## For loops

## While loops
